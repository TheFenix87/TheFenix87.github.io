<h1>Hockey Time Machine: Looking back on the NHL's first opening night 100 years ago</h1>
<div class="article">	
	<p>On Dec. 19, 1917, the opening night of the newly-minted NHL, there were four teams ready to play a 22-game schedule: Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Toronto “Arenas” (they didn't have an official team name), and Ottawa Senators.</p>
	<p>There was supposed to be another team, the Quebec Bulldogs, but their owners were tired of losing money between low attendance and high salaries. Lacking enough investment capital, they called it quits before the season started; they'd change their mind and rejoin the league in 1919-20. Their “temporary” replacement, the Arenas, are still going strong as the Maple Leafs, while the Bulldogs relocated, then disappeared for good in 1925.</p>
	<p>The rules of 1917 are almost completely unimaginable today. Forward passing was not allowed and line changes didn't exist. Teams had 14 players total, and that included only one goalie, who could not leave their feet to make a save. If they did, they were subject to a fine, but that changed in the second half of the season, thanks to the antics of goalie Clint Benedict.</p>
	<p>Oh, and did I mention goalies had to serve their own penalties (which were 3 minutes, not 2)? Any player could substitute in goal during a goalie penalty, so you could only hope your players had quick reflexes and your goalie could stay out of the box. </p>
	<p>Equipment was a bare minimum, but scoring was not. A team scoring 10 goals in a game was not uncommon, and teams hit 15 goals in a game four times. The season was divided into halves, each with their own champion, icing was unheard of, and only one arena, Westmount, had artificial ice-making.</p>
	<p>The NHL's end-of-season championship wasn't the Stanley Cup, but the O'Brien Cup. To win the Stanley Cup, you had to beat the Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHA) champion, and do it playing part of the series using PCHA rules.</p>
	<p>Opening night of the 1917-18 season was a veritable who's who of future Hall of Famers. Joe “Phantom” Malone was there. So was Edouard “Newsy” Lalonde, Georges Vezina, Didier “Cannonball” Pitre, Joe “Bad Joe” Hall, Reg Noble, Harry “Hap” Holmes, Jack Darragh, Cy Denneny, Clint “Praying Benny” Benedict and Jack Adams (in his final season as a player), to name just some. Even Ted Lindsay's dad Bert was there, in net for the Wanderers.</p>
	<p>The first game in NHL history was played at Westmount Arena in front of 700 fans, despite an offer of free tickets to soldiers. Not exactly an auspicious start for the Wanderers.</p>
	<p>They won, though, defeating Toronto, 10-9. Wanderers defenseman Dave Ritchie scored the first goal in NHL history; Wanderers right wing Harry Hyland (also a future Hall of Famer) scored the first hat trick in NHL history, then added two more for good measure. Reg Noble scored four goals for Toronto. Art Ross, a Wanderers reserve player, scored his first and only NHL goal and earned the first NHL penalty.</p>
	<p>It was to be the Wanderers' only victory and the team ceased to exist after their arena burned down in early January 1918.</p>
	<p>The second game of the night featured a contract disputed and a packed house. Ottawa's Dey Arena normally held around 4,500. On this night, it held an estimated 6,000, which made the ice a little mushy. Joe “Phantom” Malone scored five of the Canadiens' seven goals; he would score an amazing 44 goals in 20 games that season.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, Senators right wing Jack Darragh and defenseman Hamby Shore were sitting out the first period, refusing to play until their contracts were reworked to their approval. That happened partway through the second period and they joined the game in progress, but it was too late. Trailing 3-0 in the second, they would lose 7-4.</p>
	<p>Tonight’s games will feature 23-man rosters and a level of pomp and circumstance unheard of in 1917, including the singing of national anthems. Radio coverage of games was still several years away, with national radio coverage even further away. Tonight, there will be regional radio and television coverage along with national broadcasts in two countries, all of which can be accessed nearly anywhere around the globe.</p>
	<p>On March 30, the Arenas defeated the Vancouver Millionaires in a best-of-five series for the Stanley Cup. The current season won’t end until April 7. The O’Brien Cup was retired in 1950 after several changes; the Stanley Cup, which has only not been awarded twice since then, will be awarded this season sometime in early to mid June. </p>
